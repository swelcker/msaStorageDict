## How to create the documentation

We use mkdocs and mkdocsstring. The code reference and nav entry get's created virtually by the triggered python script /docs/gen_ref_pages.py while ``mkdocs`` ``serve`` or ``build`` is executed.

### Requirements Install for the PDF creation option:
PDF Export is using mainly weasyprint, if you get some errors here pls. check there documentation. Installation is part of the msaStorageDict, so this should be fine.

We can now test and view our documentation using:

    mkdocs serve

Build static Site:

    mkdocs build


## Build and Publish
  
Build:  

    python setup.py sdist

Publish to pypi:

    twine upload dist/*
