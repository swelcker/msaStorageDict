# msaStorageDict

storagedict contains a collection of dictionary classes backed by a
data store (Redis, Zookeeper, memory, etc) suitable for use in a
distributed system. Dictionary values are cached locally in the instance
of the dictionary, and synced with their values and the backed
data store when a value in the data store has changed.

## Usage

storagedict contains various types of dictionary-like objects backed
by a data store. All dict classes are located in the
`msaStorageDict` package. Currently the following
dicts are supported:

1.  `msaStorageDict.redis.MSARedisDict` - Backed by Redis.
2.  `msaStorageDict.zookeeper.MSAZookeeperDict` - Backed by Zookeeper.
3.  `msaStorageDict.memory.MSAMemoryDict` - Backed by Memory.

Each dictionary class has a different `__init__` method which take
different arguments, so consult their documentation for specific usage
detail.

Once you have an instance of a storagedict, just use it like you would a
normal dictionary:

```python
{!./docs_src/home/index_first.py!}
```

All dict types pickle their objects inside their durable data store, so
any object that is \"pickleable\" can be saved to those stores.

!!! note "Notes on Persistence, Consistency and the In-Memory Cache"

    Nearly all methods called on a msaStorageDict dictionary class (i.e.
    `MSARedisDict`) are proxied to an internal dict object that serves as a
    cache for access to dict values. This cache is only updated with fresh
    values from durable storage if there actually has been a change in the
    values stored in durable storage.
    
    To check if the data in durable storage has changed, each msaStorageDict
    backend is responsible for providing a fast `last_updated()` method that
    quickly tells the dict the last time any value in the durable storage
    has been updated. For instance, the `msaStorageDict` constructor requires a
    `cache` object passed in as an argument, which provides implementations
    of cache-line interface methods for maintaining the `last_updated`
    state. A memcache client is a good candidate for this object.
    
    Out of the box by default, all msaStorageDict classes will sync with their
    durable data store on all writes (insert, updates and deletes) as well
    as immediately before any read operation on the dictionary. This mode
    provides *high read consistency* of data at the expense of read speed.
    You can be guaranteed that any read operation on your dict, i.e.
    `settings['feature']`, will always use the most up to date data. If
    another consumer of your durable data store has modified a value in that
    store since you instantiated your object, you will immediately be able
    to read the new data with your dict instance.

## Manually Control MSA Storage Dict Sync

As mentioned above in, the downside to syncing with durable storage
before each read of dict data is it lowers your read performance. If you
read 100 keys from your dictionary, that means 100 accesses to check
`` `last_updated() ``. Even with a data store as fast as memecache, that
adds up quite quickly.

It therefore may be advantageous for you to *not* sync with durable
storage before every read from the dict and instead control that syncing
manually. To do so, pass `autosync=False` when you construct the dict,
i.e.:
```python
from msaStorageDict import MSARedisDict
from redis import Redis

# Construct a new RedisDict object that does not sync on reads
settings = MSARedisDict('settings', Redis(), autosync=False)
```

This causes the dictionary behave in the following way:

1.  Like normal, the dictionary initializes from the durable data store
    upon instantiation.
2.  Writes (both inserts and updates), along with deletes of values to
    the dictionary will still automatically sync with the data store
    each time the operation happens.
3.  Any time a dictionary is read from, *only data current in the
    internal cache is used*. The dict *will not attempt to sync with its
    durable data store* before reads.
4.  To force the dict to attempt to sync with its durable data store,
    you may call the `sync()` method on the dictionary. As with when
    `autosync` is false, if `last_update` says there are no changes, the
    dict will skip updating from durable storage.

A good use case for manual syncing is a read-heavy web application,
where you\'re using a msaStorageDict for settings configuration. Very few
requests actually *change* the dictionary contents - most simply read
from the dictionary. In this situation, you would perhaps only `sync()`
at the beginning of a user\'s web request to make sure the dict is up to
date, but then not during the request in order to push the response to
the user as fast as possible.

# Encoding

All `msaStorageDict` implementations accept an `encoding` keyword argument,
which defines the encoding object the dictionary should use when
serializing data to and from the persistent data store. The overarching
goal of the `encoding` is to serialize the dictionary value object into
a format suitable for persisting to durable storage, and then at a later
date reconstructing that object from its serialized representation into
an object in memory.

By default, [msaStorageDict]{.title-ref} uses pickle as its encoding
format, which allows it to serialize complex object easily at the
expense of \`known security implications\`:security and other
limitations. See \`this IBM Developerworks\`:devworks article for an
overview of Pickle.

In addition to the built in `encoding.PickleEncoding`, `msaStorageDict`
also features `encoding.JSONEncoding` which encodes the data as JSON and
`encoding.NoOpEncoding` which does not encode the data at all (suitable
only for the `MemoryDict` implementation).


# Creating Your Own MSA Storage Dict

Creating your own MSA Storage dict is easy. All you need to do is subclass
`msaStorageDict.base.MSAStorageDict` and implement the following required
interface methods.

1.  `persist(key, value)` - Persist `value` at `key` to your data store.
2.  `depersist(key)` - Delete the value at `key` from your data store.
3.  `durables()` - Return a `key=val` dict of all keys in your data
    store.
4.  `last_updated()` - A comparable value of when the data in your data
    store was last updated.

You may also implement a couple optional dictionary methods, which
`msaStorageDict.base.MSAStorageDict` will call when the actual non-underscored
version is called on the dict.

1.  `_pop(key[,default])` - If `key` is in the dictionary, remove it and
    return its value, else return `default`. If `default` is not given
    and `key` is not in the dictionary, a `KeyError` is raised.
2.  `_setdefault(key[,default])` - If key is in the dictionary, return
    its value. If not, insert key with a value of `default` and return
    `default`. `default` defaults to `None`.
